# vCaptcha
> CAPTCHA for Vietnamese

## About our project
Most of the recent breakthroughs in AI-related research and applications are data driven. Annotated data plays the main role in improving AI/ML-based solutions. The lack of high-quality annotated data is one of the main obstacles to AI adoption. Manual annotation is expensive and not scalable. This project aims to tackle the problem by developing a crowdsourcing system for labeling machine learning datasets, to be specific, Vietnamese scene text with word-level annotations.

In this work, we will build a crowdsourcing data annotation system - vCaptcha - in the formation of an anti-bot widget to integrate to the web page you are visiting. After that, your response will help evaluate and generate the crowdsourced labels.

At the end, a high-quality annotated dataset will be proudly made in Vietnam, and significantly contributed to the development of Vietnamese science.

## Volunteer
Just by interacting with vCaptcha, you can significantly help contribute to create a high-quality annotated dataset. The anti-bot is just a feature that you can ignore since we know when you read this you must be a human. We hope that you can spend time labeling as accurately as possible using vCaptcha.
